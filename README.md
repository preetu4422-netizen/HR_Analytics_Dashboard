# HR_Analytics_Dashboard

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: HR Analytics Dashboard

This project presents an HR Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze employee attrition trends and workforce demographics. The dashboard helps HR teams and management identify key factors influencing attrition and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention.

## Objectives

The objective of the HR Analytics Dashboard is to provide HR teams and leadership with a data-driven view of employee attrition and workforce demographics, enabling them to:

1. Identify key drivers of attrition such as salary bands, age groups, tenure, and job roles.
2. Understand workforce distribution across education, gender, departments, and roles.
3. Pinpoint high-risk employee segments (e.g., early-tenure employees, low-salary groups).
4. Support evidence-based HR decisions that improve employee retention, reduce turnover costs, and enhance organizational stability.

## Tech Stack

This dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

1. **Power BI Desktop** – Main platform for data visualization and interactive report creation.
2. **Power Query** – Used for data transformation, cleaning, and preparation.
3. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Custom measures and calculations for attrition KPIs.
4. **Data Modeling** – Established relationships among employee attributes, departments, and attrition data.
5. **File Formats** – .pbix for dashboard, .png for static preview.

## Explanation of Charts

### 1. Attrition by Education Field (Donut Chart)

Shows the distribution of attrition across education backgrounds.
< br / > **Insight:**
1. Most attrition happens in Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) fields, which together make up two-thirds of total attrition.
2. HR can investigate whether career development or job satisfaction issues are higher in these groups.

### 2. Attrition by Age (Bar Chart)

Displays how many employees left based on age groups.
**Insight:**
1. Employees aged 26–35 have the highest attrition (116 employees). Younger employees (18–25) also have a significant number (44).
2. This indicates that early-career professionals are more likely to leave, possibly for better opportunities.

### 3. Attrition by Salary Slab (Horizontal Bar Chart)

Breaks down attrition by salary brackets.
**Insight:**
1. Employees earning up to 5K salary have the highest attrition (163 employees). Attrition drops drastically as salary increases.
2. This shows that low pay is a key driver of attrition.

### 4. Attrition by Years at Company (Line Chart)

Tracks attrition across employee tenure.
**Insight:** 
1. Attrition is highest in the first 1–2 years (peaks at 23 employees in year 1). It reduces significantly in mid-tenure and slightly rises again around year 10.
2. Suggests that new hires are most at risk of leaving if not properly engaged or onboarded.

### 5. Attrition by Job Role (Horizontal Bar Chart)

Highlights which job roles face the most attrition.
**Insight:**
1. Laboratory Technician (62)
2. Sales Executive (57)
3. Research Scientist (47)
4. Sales Representative (33)
These roles show higher instability and may require tailored retention programs.

### 6. Attrition by Gender (Stacked Column Chart)

Compares male vs female attrition.
**Insight:**
1. Attrition is higher among males (140) compared to females (79).
2. HR can explore whether job expectations, work-life balance, or industry norms are influencing this.

### 7. Attrition by Department & Job Role Matrix (Table)

A detailed grid showing attrition counts across different departments and roles.
**Insight:**
1. Laboratory Technicians (62) stand out in R&D.
2. Sales Executives (57) in Sales show high attrition.
3. Human Resources and Managers have lower attrition.
4. Helps identify which departments need the most retention focus.

## Insights for HR Actions

1. **Salary**: Majority attrition is among lower salary bands (<5K).
2. **Age & Tenure:** Young employees (18–35) and those in early tenure are more likely to leave.
3. **Roles:** Sales and Laboratory roles show the highest attrition.
